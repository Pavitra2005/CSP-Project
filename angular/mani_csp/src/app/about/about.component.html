                   <p>In the middle age, people had only one notion about the woman; that is, they were born
                      to control the household chores and manage the children.
                      But in today’s world, women empowerment has taken place 
                      which has opened new doors for the women to thrive and shine.

   <p>Women empowerment refers to making women powerful to make them capable 
     of deciding for themselves. Women have suffered a lot through the years 
     at the hands of men. In earlier centuries, they were treated as almost non-existent.
      As if all the rights belonged to men even something as basic as
      voting. As the times evolved, women realized their power. There on began the revolution for women empowerment.
      As women were not allowed to make decisions for them, women empowerment came in like a breath of fresh air.
       It made them aware of their rights and how they must make their own place in society rather than depending on a man. 
       It recognized the fact that things cannot simply work in someone’s favor because of their gender. However, we still
        have a long way to go when we talk about the reasons why we need it.Almost every country, no matter how progressive
         has a history of ill-treating women. In other words, women from all over the world have been rebellious to reach the
         status they have today.While the western countries are still making progress, third world countries like India still 
         lack behind in Women Empowerment.In India, women empowerment is needed more than ever. India is amongst the countries 
         which are not safe for women. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, women in India are in danger 
         of honor killings. Their family thinks its right to take their lives if they bring shame to the reputation of their legacy.</p>

     <p>Moreover, the education and freedom scenario is very regressive here. Women are not allowed to pursue higher education,
          they are married off early. The men are still dominating women in some regions like it’s the woman’s duty to work for 
          him endlessly. They do not let them go out or have freedom of any kind.Women must be given equal opportunities in every
           field, irrespective of gender. Moreover, they must also be given equal pay. We can empower women by abolishing child
            marriage. Various programs must be held where they can be taught skills to fend for themselves in case they face financial
             crisis.Women empowerment is one of the most debated social topics. It means recognising the importance of gender equality, 
             and women’s participation in decision-making and offering them equal opportunities in education, employment, others. Women 
             empowerment talks about making women strong so that they can lead a healthy and prosperous life and contribute to the development
             of society. Today we will be discussing some sample essay on women empowerment, which will cover details like how can eliminatediscrimination 
             against women, challenge traditional gender roles, and promote equal opportunities for women in various aspects of life.Women 
             empowerment refers to the practice of making women independent so that they can make their own decisions and take decisions without
             any familial or societal restrictions. In simple terms, it entitles women to take charge of their personal development. 
             The patriarchal society has always deprived women of their rights.

     <p>The word ‘Women Empowerment’ itself implies that women are not powerful enough - they need to be empowered. This painful truth 
         has been in existence for a long long time. It is in recent years that noticeable work started beginning to lift women out of 
         the abyss of insignificance and powerlessness. The patriarchal society suppressed women’s freedom across the world. Women were
          not allowed to vote or even put forward any opinion. Women were confined to their homes. As time progressed, they realised that
           their life meant much more than just serving in the household. As more and more women started crossing the man-made barriers,
            the world began to witness the rise of women. Unlike men, women never try to stifle the voice of their opposite gender. They
             hold the hands of all the downtrodden people - men and women both - and they pull them out of misfortune as they try to
              improve their lives.No woman can be empowered if she is not financially independent. Gone are the days when women had to
               depend on their fathers or husbands to get things that they wanted. From the 20th century onwards women got more opportunities
                to join the workforce. However, at the same time, many women in England were forced to work both in the workplace and in the
                 household to support the family. After the Second World War women, on their own, chose to join the workforce. Today more and
                  more jobs are opening up for women. Women are proving to be worthy of the designations assigned to them.
